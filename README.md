# Introduction :v:
Yes, this is another social distancing implementation. 

It is inspired by the fantastic work done by researchers at IIT-Pavis which you can find [here](https://github.com/IIT-PAVIS/Social-Distancing).

How is it different?  
:point_right: Easy to follow end-to-end workflow.  
:point_right: Super simple calibration.  
:point_right: Run locally using a local detections file, or call an external inference service.  
:point_right: Already integrated into [IBM Visual Insights](https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-visual-insights) for inference calls, and easy to rip and replace with another inference engine.
